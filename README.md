# common-build-dependencies

`common-build-dependencies` contains packages to build other packages. Runtime
dependencies should be placed into
[shared-userspace](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/modules/shared-userspace.git/).
This git repository represents two modules:

 1. [`common-build-dependencies`](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/modules/common-build-dependencies.git/)
 2. [`common-build-dependencies-bootstrap`](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/modules/common-build-dependencies-bootstrap.git/)

At early stages, plenty of modules will be present only in
`common-build-dependencies-bootstrap`. You should check dist-git what's the
current content of the modules.


## Workflow

If you need to add a package to this module, please open a pull request and add
a new entry to section **Requests**.

Example:

```markdown
Hello, I am trying to build golang module and I need these packages to be included in this module:

 * hostname
   * dependency of:
     * golang
 * perl
   * dependency of:
     * golang
```


## API
