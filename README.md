# common-build-dependencies

`common-build-dependencies` is probably the module, which you need to
`build-require` in order to build your module.

This git repository represents two modules:

 1. [`common-build-dependencies`](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/modules/common-build-dependencies.git/)
 2. [`common-build-dependencies-bootstrap`](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/modules/common-build-dependencies-bootstrap.git/)

At early stages, plenty of modules will be present only in
`common-build-dependencies-bootstrap`. You should check dist-git what's the
current content of the modules.
